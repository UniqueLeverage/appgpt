# Unique Leverage â€” Vite React Starter (appgpt repo)

This scaffold lets you deploy your app directly from GitHub.

## How to use
1. Your full React code is already in `src/App.jsx`.
2. Commit everything to your repo (`UniqueLeverage/appgpt`).
3. Push to `main`. GitHub Actions will build & deploy.

## Local (optional)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
- Workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` handles build + deploy.
- Visit `https://<user>.github.io/appgpt/` once live.
